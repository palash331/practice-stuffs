Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets.
An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file.
To store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store to a bucket.
Buckets are the containers for objects. You can control access to each bucket, view access logs for it
and its objects.
