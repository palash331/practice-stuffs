Scala - Scalable and Language.
It runs on JVM.
Has access to all Java libraries and tools.
Both function oriented and object-oriented language

Scala is statically typed, allowing us to find error at compile time. 
It is a pure object-oriented language with no primitive data types.
Everything in Scala is object.

Variables are defined using val and var.
val - immutable. It's value can't be changed.
var - One can change it's value.

Syntax for declaring a variable:

val(or var) name: datatype
